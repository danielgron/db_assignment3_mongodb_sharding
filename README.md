The database is set up across 5 azure virtual machines:
![mongo setup](mongo.drawio.png)

A full script to set up database can be found udner cloud/native/setup.sh.
This will require Azure CLI installed and an azure subscription to run.

Firewall restricts all outside access to port 80/443 (no ssl has been set up though).
